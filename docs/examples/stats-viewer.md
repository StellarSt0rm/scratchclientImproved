# Stats Viewer

This is the server code for a "stats viewer" project.

```python title="stats_viewer.py"
# This stats viewer can retrieve a user's follower and following count
# This assumes that the project has four cloud variables: "Follower Count Request",
# "Follower Count Response", "Following Count Request",
# and "Following Count Response". The "Follower Count Request" and
# "Following Count Request" variables will be set
# by people using the project, and will contain the username of the user
# requesting the data, a delimiter, and the username of the user for which 
# they want the statistics. The "Follower Count Response" and "Following Count Response"
# variables will be set by the server (this program) and will contain the username
# of the user who sent the request, a delimiter, and the number of followers.

    # An example response would be something like 021502001000
